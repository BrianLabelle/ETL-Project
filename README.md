# ETLProject | Vote - Tax - FIPS
Richard Harris | Brian Labelle

## Background
HarLabs has been tasked with merging data sources from the 2016 Primary Election results with 2014 Salary / Wages.
We used a 3rd data source to merge on the zipcode based on the US County FIPS. FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) are a set of standards that describe document processing, encryption algorithms and other information technology standards for use within non-military government agencies and by government contractors and vendors who work with the agencies.
